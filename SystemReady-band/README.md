## Introduction
SystemReady band is a band of system compliance in the Arm SystemReady program that ensures interoperability of Arm based servers with standard operating systems and hypervisors.

SystemReady band compliant platforms must implement a minimum set of hardware and firmware features that an operating system can depend on to deploy the operating system image. 

The SystemReady band compliance and testing requirements are specified in the [Arm SystemReady Requirements Specification (SRS)](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0109/latest)

## Prebuilt Images
- Prebuilt images for each release are available in the prebuilt_images folder.To access the prebuilt_images, click [prebuilt_images](prebuilt_images/).
- The prebuilt images are archived after compression to the .xz format. On Linux, use the xz utility to uncompress the image <br />
  `xz -d  systemready_acs_live_image.img.xz` <br />
   On Windows, use the 7zip or a similar utility.
- If you choose to use the prebuilt image, skip the build steps and navigate to the [Verification on Arm Neoverse N2 reference design](#verification-on-arm-neoverse-n2-reference-design).

## Steps to Manually Build Image

## Verification on Arm Neoverse N2 reference design

Note: UEFI EDK2 setting for "Console Preference": The default is "Graphical". When that is selected, Linux output will goes to the graphical console (HDMI monitor). To force serial console output, you may change the "Console Preference" to "Serial".

### Software stack and Model

Follow the steps mentioned in [RD-N2 platform software user guide](https://neoverse-reference-design.docs.arm.com/en/latest/platforms/rdn2.html) to obtain RD-N2 FVP.

#### Prerequisites
sudo permission is required for  building RD-N2 software stack.

#### For software stack build instructions, follow BusyBox Boot link under Supported Features by RD-N2 platform software stack section in the same guide.

Note: After the download of software stack code, please do the below changes before starting the build steps.<br />
RD-N2 should be built with the GIC changes as mentioned below as applicable.<br />
- If the system supports LPIs (Interrupt ID > 8192) then firmware should support installation of handler for LPI interrupts.
    - If you are using edk2, change the ArmGic driver in the ArmPkg to support installation of handler for LPIs.
    - Add the following in \<path to RDN2 software stack\>/uefi/edk2/ArmPkg/Drivers/ArmGic/GicV3/ArmGicV3Dxe.c
>        - After [#define ARM_GIC_DEFAULT_PRIORITY  0x80]
>          +#define ARM_GIC_MAX_NUM_INTERRUPT 16384
>        - Change this in GicV3DxeInitialize function.
>          -mGicNumInterrupts      = ArmGicGetMaxNumInterrupts (mGicDistributorBase);
>          +mGicNumInterrupts      = ARM_GIC_MAX_NUM_INTERRUPT;


### Model run command

1. Set the environment variable 'MODEL' <br />
  `export MODEL=<absolute path to the RD-N2 FVP binary/FVP_RD_N2>`

3. Launch the RD-N2 FVP with the pre-built image with the following command <br />
  `cd /path to RD-N2_FVP platform software/model-scripts/rdinfra/platforms/rdn2` <br />
  `./run_model.sh -v /path-to-systemready-acs-live-image/systemready_acs_live_image.img`

**Note: When verifying ACS on hardware, ensure that ACS image is not in two different boot medias (USB, NVMe drives etc) attached to the device.**


Known limitations:<br />
On FVP models, with versions previous to 11.15.23, during the execution of the UEFI-SCT suite, the following behavior is observed:

1. Execution of the 'UEFIRuntimeServices' tests may cause the test execution on FVP to stall and become non-responsive.
The message displayed prior to this stall would be either “System may reset after 1 second…” or a print associated with 'SetTime' tests.

The FVP execution must be terminated and restarted by running the run_model.sh script to continue with the execution of the tests.
The execution continues from the test that is next in sequence of the test prior to FVP stall.

2. It may appear that the test execution has stalled with the message “Waiting for few seconds for signal …” displayed on the console.
This is expected behavior and the progress of tests will continue after a 20-minute delay.


## Security Implication
Arm SystemReady band ACS test suite may run at higher privilege level. An attacker may utilize these tests as a means to elevate privilege which can potentially reveal the platform security assets. To prevent the leakage of Secure information, it is strongly recommended that the ACS test suite is run only on development platforms. If it is run on production systems, the system should be scrubbed after running the test suite.
