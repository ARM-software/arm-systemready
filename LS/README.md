# SystemReady LS

## Introduction to SystemReady LS
 
SystemReady LS is tailored to meet the needs of many hyperscalers on systems based on server Arm SoCs.

SystemReady LS-certified platforms implement a minimum set of hardware and standard firmware interfaces. Allowing for highly customizable firmware that targets the hyperscalerâ€™s Linux environment.

* [Server Base System Architecture (SBSA) specification](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0029/d/?lang=en)
* LBBR recipe of the [Base Boot Requirements (BBR) specification](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0044/latest)
* The SystemReady LS certification and testing requirements are specified in the [Arm SystemReady Requirements Specification (SRS)](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0109/latest)

**Note: SystemReady LS ACS is not presently available, this readme contains instructions for testing and certifying systems for SystemReady LS using the SystemReady SR ACS.**


## Testing SystemReady LS using SystemReady SR ACS

The SystemReady SR Architecture Compliance Suite [SR ACS](https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-systemready/tree/main/SR) is designed to test compliance to the SBSA and SBBR requirements for SystemReady SR certification. At this time, the SR ACS tests are also leveraged to for [SystemReady LS v0.9](https://www.arm.com/architecture/system-architectures/systemready-certification-program/ls) certification. This includes testing compliance to the SBSA and LBBR requirements for SystemReady LS.
