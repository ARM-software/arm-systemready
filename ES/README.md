# SystemReady ES ACS


## Introduction to SystemReady ES
SystemReady ES - Embedded Server, is a band of system certification in the Arm SystemReady program that ensures interoperability with standard operating systems and hypervisors.

SystemReady ES-certified platforms implement a minimum set of hardware and firmware features that an operating system can depend on to deploy the operating system image. Compliant systems must conform to the:
* [Base System Architecture (BSA) specification](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0094/latest)
* SBBR recipe of the [Base Boot Requirements (BBR) specification](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0044/latest)
* The SystemReady ES certification and testing requirements are specified in the [Arm SystemReady Requirements Specification (SRS)](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0109/latest)
