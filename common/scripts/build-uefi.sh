# This script uses the following environment variables from the variant
#
# VARIANT - build variant name
# TOP_DIR - workspace root directory
# CROSS_COMPILE - PATH to GCC including CROSS-COMPILE prefix
# PARALLELISM - number of cores to build across
# UEFI_BUILD_ENABLED - Flag to enable building UEFI
# UEFI_PATH - sub-directory containing UEFI code
# UEFI_BUILD_MODE - DEBUG or RELEASE
# UEFI_TOOLCHAIN - Toolchain supported by Linaro uefi-tools: GCC49, GCC48 or GCC47
# UEFI_PLATFORMS - List of platforms to build
# UEFI_PLAT_{platform name} - array of platform parameters:
#     - platname - the name of the platform used by the build
#     - makefile - the makefile to execute for this platform
#     - output - where to store the files in packaging phase
#     - defines - extra platform defines during the build
#     - binary - what to call the final output binary
