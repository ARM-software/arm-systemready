## Introduction

The `main_log_parser.sh` script is designed to automate the processing of test suite results and the application of waivers. Waivers are exceptions granted for certain tests due to specific reasons such as hardware constraints, non-applicable features, or known issues. Applying waivers helps in accurately representing the test outcomes by acknowledging these exceptions.

The script processes log files, applies waivers using the embedded `apply_waivers.py` script, and generates JSON and HTML summary reports.

## Waiver Hierarchy

Waivers can be applied at various levels within a test suite. The hierarchy is as follows:

1. **Suite-Level Waiver**: Applies to all failed subtests in the entire suite.
2. **TestSuite-Level Waiver**: Applies to all failed subtests within a specific test suite.
3. **SubSuite-Level Waiver**: Applies to all failed subtests within a specific sub-suite (applicable for suites like `SCT`, `Standalone`, `BBSR-SCT`, `BBSR-FWTS`).
4. **TestCase-Level Waiver**: Applies to all failed subtests within a specific test case (applicable for suites like `SCT`, `Standalone`, `BBSR-SCT`, `BBSR-FWTS`).
5. **SubTest-Level Waiver**: Applies to individual subtests based on `SubTestID` or `sub_Test_Description`.

Waivers are applied in the order listed above. If a waiver is applicable at multiple levels, the most specific waiver (lowest level) takes precedence.

## Understanding the Waiver Application Process

The `apply_waivers.py` script processes waivers in a hierarchical manner:

1. **Load Waivers**: It reads the `waiver.json` file and extracts waivers relevant to the specified `SUITE_NAME`.
2. **Apply Waivers**:
   - **Suite-Level**: Waivers are applied to all failed subtests in the suite.
   - **TestSuite-Level**: Waivers are applied to all failed subtests within the specified test suites.
   - **SubSuite-Level**: Waivers are applied to all failed subtests within the specified sub-suites.
   - **TestCase-Level**: Waivers are applied to all failed subtests within the specified test cases.
   - **SubTest-Level**: Waivers are applied to individual subtests based on `SubTestID` or `sub_Test_Description`.
3. **Update Test Results**: The script adjusts pass/fail counts and annotates waived tests with the waiver reason.
4. **Output**: The updated test results JSON file replaces the original file, reflecting the applied waivers.

## Important Notes

- **Suites Supporting SubSuite/TestCase-Level Waivers**: Only certain suites (`SCT`, `Standalone`, `BBSR-SCT`, `BBSR-FWTS`) support waivers at the SubSuite and TestCase levels.
- **Waiver Application Order**: Waivers are applied from the highest level (suite) to the lowest level (subtest). Lower-level waivers override higher-level waivers if both are applicable.
- **Updating Test Results**: The script modifies the original test results JSON file. Ensure you have a backup if you need to retain the original data.
- **Waiver Effect on Statistics**: Failed tests that are waived are counted under `FAILED_WITH_WAIVER`, and the overall failed count is adjusted accordingly.
- **Error Handling**: The script skips waiver entries that are missing required fields and provides warnings if verbosity is enabled.
- **Case Sensitivity**: Suite and test names are case-sensitive. Ensure names in `waiver.json` match those in the test results.

By following the templates and guidelines provided in this document, you can effectively apply waivers to your test suite results, ensuring accurate representation of your platform's compliance and capabilities.
